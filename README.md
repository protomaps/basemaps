# Protomaps Basemaps

This repository has two core parts:

* `tiles/`: A [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) build profile that generates `planet.pmtiles` from OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth in 2-3 hours on a modest computer.
* `styles/`: A TypeScript package that generates [MapLibre GL](http://github.com/maplibre) styles, in multiple color themes, that can be used via `npm` or exported as JSON.

Assets such as fonts and sprites are hosted and downloadable at the [basemaps-assets](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps-assets) repository.

## Development

You will need [Java 21+](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed, which is available in most package managers.

Generate and inspect a basemap PMTiles of any named area:

1. Clone this repository.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:protomaps/basemaps.git
```
2. change to the `tiles` directory, download dependencies and compile the JAR:

```shell
cd basemaps/tiles
mvn clean package
```
3. Download and generate `monaco.pmtiles` in the current directory:

```shell
java -jar target/*-with-deps.jar --download --force --area=monaco
```

4. Switch to the `app/` directory to run the map frontend:

```shell
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The locally generated pmtiles can be fetched from http://localhost:5173/monaco.pmtiles

5. Linting to apply code formatting

```shell
mvn spotless:apply
```

## Licensing and Attribution Guidelines

Summary:

* All code is BSD-3
* Map design is CC0
* Tilesets are ODbL, attribute OSM
* We like shoutouts!
* Name your fork, commercial product or service something different

We kindly request that you attribute the Protomaps project if you use the basemap styles unmodified or with additions, but you are not required to do so. The visual design copyright of the maps is released under a [Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) to eliminate ambiguity around derivative or combined works of map styling code, and to publish software, such as NPM packages, under the standard BSD-3 license.

The tilesets that power the Protomaps basemap are [Produced Works of the OpenStreetMap dataset](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence/Community_Guidelines/Produced_Work_-_Guideline) under the [Open Database License](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). Web maps and native apps that use this Produced Work must visibly attribute © OpenStreetMap - for example, in the corner of the map display. If your map only uses the Map Styles with non-OpenStreetMap tilesets, this attribution is not required.

Example web map corner attribution:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps">Protomaps</a> © <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
```

Tilesets also include data from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com), which does not require corner attribution. Other data sources your map uses may require additional attribution.

The software in this repository is made available under a [BSD 3-Clause License](/LICENSE.md), and includes license notices related to Protomaps LLC, Mapzen, and the Linux Foundation. You must retain these license notices in software source code derived from this repository.

If you distribute a modified “fork” of these basemap styles or tilesets, or provide a tiles API based on them, you must name your product or service something different from Protomaps. Free and unmodified redistributions of tiles and styles are permitted to use the name. No restrictions apply to the underlying technology `.pmtiles` which is an [open specification in the public domain.](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles#license)
